<p>First Java Project “HelloWorld”</p>

<ol>
<li>After launching Eclipse, close the welcome tab (if it appears)</li>
<li>On the left-hand side you should see a panel with a tab called “Package Explorer”.</li>
<li>Right click on any empty space within this panel</li>
<li>Move your mouse over “New” Then click “Java Project” (this tutorial doesn’t cover Maven Repositories. For maven you have to make a very similar “Maven Project” which will be discussed later)</li>
<li>Name your project anything. First project is typically named “HelloWorld” (without quotes).</li>
<li>Click “Finish” in the bottom right-hand corner</li>
<li>Double-click the newly created project in the “Package Explorer” panel</li>
<li>Right-click the “src” folder</li>
<li>Move your mouse over “New“. Then click “Class” (You can name the class the same as the project name)</li>
<li>Uncheck the checkbox asking to create a module. You probably don’t need it. I’ve never needed it.</li>
<li>Click Finish</li>
<li>Standard first test project (what I’m doing now) is to just print out “Hello World!” into the console. Use the code below to do that</li>
</ol>
<pre>
public class HelloWorld {
//Main method, executes your code, just memorize it for now
    public static void main(String[]args) {
        //Prints out the text in quotes
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
